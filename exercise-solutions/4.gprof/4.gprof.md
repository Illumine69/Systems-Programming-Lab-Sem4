### Practice exercises:

1. 
    1.  Run the **secretapp** executable file once with the gprof tool and save the profile data using the `-p` flag.
    2.  Repeat step 1 **nine** more times to have a total of ten independent runs of secretapp.
    3.  Combine the profile data generated by the ten runs of secretapp using the gprof `-s` flag followed by the `-p` flag. For example, if you have saved the profile data from each run in separate files such as prof1.out, prof2.out, ..., prof10.out, you can combine them using the following command:       

            gprof -s -p prof1.out prof2.out prof3.out prof4.out prof5.out prof6.out prof7.out prof8.out prof9.out prof10.out > combined_profile.out

        > This will generate a combined profile data file named combined_profile.out.

        Finally, you can analyze the combined profile data using gprof to get insights into the performance of secretapp.       

            gprof -b combined_profile.out

        > This will display the profile data sorted by the amount of time spent in each function.

2.  Using gprof, we find that function **lpd()** takes **>99%** of the computation time. We can observe that `lpd = n / spd`. Hence, we can modify the function lpd as-       

        lpd(int n, int spd){
            return n / spd;
        }
