1.  1. Delete in the same order as the sorted linked list i.e. `4 → 5 → 8 → 9 → 13 → 14 → 18 → 20`. 
Amount of definitely lost memory = 1*sizeof(node)
    2. Delete in the reverse order of the sorted linked list i.e. `20 → 18 → 14 → 13 → 9 → 8 → 5 → 4`.  
    Amount of definitely lost memory = 8*sizeof(node)
